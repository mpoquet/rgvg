Allay
- The winner of the Minecraft Live 2021 Mob Vote is flying into Minecraft!
- Instantly recognizable by its luminous blue sheen, you won’t lose this mob once you find it
- Hand it an item and it will pick up matching items it finds in the world
- It loves music and will drop items if it hears a note block playing nearby
- The allay spawns in pillager outposts and woodland mansions and is waiting for you to set it free!

Boat in chest
- The Wild Update makes it possible for you to craft a boat with a chest on it, which is convenient since there are plenty of new blocks to bring back from your new adventures!

Deep dark
- In the depths of the Overworld, you will find one of the scariest biomes in all of Minecraft
- Buried underground, espeically at the bottom of mountainous regions, this area is filled with sculk blocks, ancient structures, loot chests, and one, single, solitary mob
- To navigate the deep dark, you need to sneak, use Silk Touch, and above all else — don’t wake the warden!

Recovery compass & echo shards
- The recovery compass is the solution for finding the way back to the last location you died
- Loot chests in ancient cities to discover echo shards and craft one for yourself!

Sculk blocks
- There are five different types of sculk blocks to be found in the deep dark
- If you want to mine them, you will need to stay stealthy and use Silk Touch
- The sculk block is a great decorative block thanks to its atmospheric glow
- The sculk sensor is a redstone block that detects vibrations, so walk carefully or use a wool block to muffle your steps
- The sculk catalyst spreads sculk around it and sculk veins generate around patches of sculk that spawn from the sculk catalyst
- Finally, the sculk shrieker is possibly the most dangerous block of all since it will summon the warden if you’re not careful!

Warden
- The only mob that spawns in the deep dark is none other than the warden
- The warden will only make an appearance if its slumber is disturbed, which means that brave explorers must sneak around very quietly
- Quick movements risk setting off a sculk sensor that trigger a sculk shrieker
- If you have the misfortune of hearing it pierce through the silent shroud of the deep dark, it’s time to get out
- Even though the warden can’t see, this doesn’t slow it down but works to its advantage
- The warden can sniff out any intruders and uses vibrations to detect their exact location
