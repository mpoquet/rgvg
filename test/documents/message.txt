This is a message from the USS Sinclair. We are broadcasting this on all known 
frequencies. This is a distress message. We have suffered great damage. We 
cannot abandon ship. The main engines are unusable. We are running low on 
supplie-
Hello. This is the USS Sinclair again. Power is running out. We turned lights 
off. Shields won't last much longer either, we've gathered all passengers in a 
hall, they should be safe from asteroids.
This is the Captain of the USS Sinclair speaking. Someone caught a cold. It's 
spreading too fast to stop. If you are hearing this message, our last known 
coordinates are-


Hi. Sinclair again. Most if us are sick. Our last engine left isn't doing so 
hot. We're running low on everything. Crew found a safe way to a latch,
we're transmitting the path attached. Please come save us.



Hey. It's me. Uuuh. I'm not sure the tower still works. If you can hear this; 
hi. Most of us died. Hunger, fights, illness. A group of passengers sealed 
themselves in the Machines. Control Room was apparently destroyed by an 
asteroid. Oh, yeah, shields are off. Everything is off. well. almost 
everything. we're out of food, water, and we've got enough oxygen for a few 
hours at most. i'll break out the news to what's left of the crew in a minute. 
don't bother coming to save us. radiation shielding is falling apart fast 
anyway, guess we should have turned the engines off sooner. uuh. yeah. that's 
about it. it's been a great journey. who am i kidding this was hell from the 
start. see you in the stars, i guess.
