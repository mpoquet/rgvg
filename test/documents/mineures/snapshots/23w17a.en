Sculk Sensor Phases
- Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors have three phases: Inactive, Active and Cooldown
- The default phase is Inactive
  - This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration
  - During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled
- When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase
  - This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
  - During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils and emits a redstone signal and light
- After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase
  - This phase lasts for 10 game ticks
  - During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a redstone signal nor light
  - Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase
- Previously, some of these phases had different timing values:
  - Active: 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
  - Cooldown: 1 game tick for both types of Sculk Sensors
- These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them
