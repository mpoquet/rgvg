0 ./test/documents/mineures/snapshots/23w17a.en 30 - Both types of Sculk Sensors now stay in their Cooldown phase for 10 ticks, with other phase timings being adjusted to compensate
1 ./test/documents/mineures/snapshots/23w17a.en 35 Sculk Sensor Phases
2 ./test/documents/mineures/snapshots/23w17a.en 36 - Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors have three phases: Inactive, Active and Cooldown
3 ./test/documents/mineures/snapshots/23w17a.en 41   - This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
4 ./test/documents/mineures/snapshots/23w17a.en 48   - Active: 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
5 ./test/documents/mineures/snapshots/23w17a.en 49   - Cooldown: 1 game tick for both types of Sculk Sensors
6 ./test/documents/mineures/snapshots/23w17a.en 50 - These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them
7 ./test/documents/the-wild-update.19.en 5 - Sneak 100 â€” Sneaking next to a Sculk Sensor without triggering it
